# Arquitetura-Computadores-MIPS
 This repository contains my work from the Computer Architecture and Organization course, including MIPS assembly code projects. It includes implementations of programming concepts, instruction sets, and architecture-specific tasks. The code shows solutions to various problems and exercises related to how computer systems process data at the assembly level.
